Our project is all about an intelligent platform for predicting the prices of agri-horticultural commodities using AI/ML models. 
The platform helps farmers, vendors, and consumers with actionable insights into future price trends, enabling better decision-making. 
Additionally, we integrate features like Interactive Map and Real-time Market News to make the platform more comprehensive.
